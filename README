Modified Whisper-server module for OpenSim
Original and client program can be found at http://whisper.vcomm.ch/forum/

Build and install as original

in OpenSim.ini, section [MurmurVoice] add the following parameters:

        murmur_AgentPass = "AShortPassword"
        murmur_EstateChannel = "EstateVoiceChannel"

murmur_AgentPass: is a password for agents, so its identical across your sims (replaces a random component original code used)
murmur_EstateChannel: defines the channel for all parcels without "Restrict voice to this parcel" (in about land -> media) unchecked

channel_name: this original setting is no longer used. Region parent voice channel is now the region name

this module still needs a lot of work

TP to sims without this module and TP back work bad because client code doesn't request parcelvoice information on return to same region
so you may end up talking on the wrong parcel.
Is a bad ideia to keep users coonected when they TP out to a sim without this module, client should disconnect on this TPs ( or all ?)
