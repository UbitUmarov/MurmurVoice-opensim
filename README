Modified Whisper-server module for OpenSim
Original and client program can be found at http://whisper.vcomm.ch/forum/

Build and install as original

in OpenSim.ini, section [MurmurVoice] add the following parameters:

        murmur_AgentPass = "AShortPassword"
        murmur_EstateChannel = "EstateVoiceChannel"

murmur_AgentPass: is a password for agents, so its identical across your sims (replaces a random component original code used)
murmur_EstateChannel: defines the channel for all parcels without "Restrict voice to this parcel" (in about land -> media) unchecked

channel_name: this original setting is no longer used. Region parent voice channel is now the region name

this module still needs a lot of work
warning: user registrarions are (for now) not being deleted on murmur server.
